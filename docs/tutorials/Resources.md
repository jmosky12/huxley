# Overview
This is to serve as a collection of resources on things that need to be understood for anyone just starting out on Huxley. The order here is suggested, but for each person the order in which these things are learned might be more helpful one way or another.

## Languages
These are the languages that you will be working in. In general [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm), and [W3Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/) has good introductory material.
### Python

### JavaScript

## Frameworks
These are the frameworks we use for Huxley. On the backend we use Django's models and views, and on the frontend we use Flux to manage our data flow. ReactJS is our language of choice to support Flux.
### MVC/Django
